# SWOAmigaMagsys
Amiga magsys for Scene World Magazine

Menu structure should be self-explanatory.
Articles are in voodoo-noter format (a c64 format)
Anywhere there is packed data, it's packed with cranker
Magsys requires playsid.library
Logos should be pre-split into 5 bitplanes.  They are 64 pixels tall

Articles should have the load address stripped off
Then be crankered with the -cd and -eo flags
